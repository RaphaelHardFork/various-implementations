 *
 * {Ownable} contract is used to restrict the {deposit} action to the `owner`, this ownership

 * cannot be lowered.
 *
 * As rewards are distributed each block, rewards are represented by {_currentRewardPerBlockPerToken},
 * which calculate amount of rewards to distribute to each token staked in the contract.
 *
 * NOTE This contract is not audited, use it with caution.
 *      Utilisation of the {IERC900} seem not to be so relevant.
